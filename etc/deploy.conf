# Set values for where you'd like to post commit messages to

# to whatever service you like, or if your project tracker allows
# for input directly via email like ours does, you post directly.
# Some of these options will definitely need to be set in the 
# project's .deployrc, not in a master configuration.

# a different From: address than that of the the machine you're 
# actually deploying from.
